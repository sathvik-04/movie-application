üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
The Movie Explorer application is built upon a modern, efficient, and scalable technology stack:

Frontend Development
React.js: A leading JavaScript library for building dynamic, component-based user interfaces.

Vite: A next-generation frontend tooling solution renowned for its blazing-fast development server and optimized build performance.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that facilitates rapid UI development and enables highly customizable, responsive designs.

Backend Services
Appwrite: A secure, open-source backend-as-a-service platform offering essential core APIs for database management, user authentication, and file storage.

Data & APIs
The Movie Database (TMDB) API: Utilized for fetching an extensive range of movie data, including metadata, imagery, and trailer resources.

üåê Deployment
The Movie Explorer frontend is robustly deployed on Vercel, celebrated for its superior performance and streamlined developer experience. All backend services are efficiently managed and hosted via Appwrite Cloud.

CORS Resolution Strategy
To ensure secure and uninterrupted communication between the Vercel-hosted frontend and the Appwrite Cloud backend, the Vercel deployment URL (https://movie-application-chi-khaki.vercel.app/) has been explicitly registered and whitelisted as an allowed platform within the Appwrite console's project settings. This precise configuration effectively mitigates and resolves Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy restrictions.

‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1 # Your Appwrite API Endpoint
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=65e12e8a09e000e6dc8d # Your Appwrite Project ID
VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY # Your TMDB API Key

Important:

Replace https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1 with the specific API endpoint of your Appwrite instance.

Replace 65e12e8a09e000e6dc8d with your unique Appwrite Project ID.

Replace YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY with your personal API key obtained from TMDB.

Installation
Clone the repository:
Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command to clone the project:

git clone https://github.com/sathvik-04/movie-application.git
cd movie-application

Install dependencies:
Navigate into the project directory and install all required Node.js dependencies:

npm install
