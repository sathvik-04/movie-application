üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
The Movie Explorer application is built using a modern and efficient tech stack:

Frontend
React.js: A powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

Vite: A cutting-edge frontend tooling that provides an exceptionally fast development server and optimized build processes.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework enabling rapid UI development and highly customizable designs.

Backend
Appwrite: A secure and open-source backend-as-a-service platform offering essential core APIs for databases, user authentication, and file storage.

Data & APIs
The Movie Database (TMDB) API: Utilized for fetching extensive movie data, including metadata, imagery, and trailers.

üåê Deployment
The Movie Explorer frontend is deployed on Vercel, known for its performance and developer-friendly environment. The robust backend services are hosted via Appwrite Cloud.

CORS Resolution
To ensure secure and seamless communication between the Vercel-hosted frontend and the Appwrite Cloud backend, the Vercel deployment URL (https://movie-application-chi-khaki.vercel.app/) has been explicitly registered as an allowed platform within the Appwrite console's project settings. This configuration effectively resolves Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies.

‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: (LTS version recommended)

npm or Yarn: Package managers for Node.js.

Appwrite Cloud Project: An active Appwrite project to serve as the backend.

TMDB API Key: A personal API key from The Movie Database (TMDB) for fetching movie data.

Environment Variables

VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1 # Your Appwrite API Endpoint
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=65e12e8a09e000e6dc8d # Your Appwrite Project ID
VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY # Your TMDB API Key

Note: Replace https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1, 65e12e8a09e000e6dc8d, and YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY with your actual Appwrite API endpoint, project ID, and TMDB API key, respectively.
